# Basic algorithm

- If the pixel 2 steps ahead is > 50% a trail, go forward
- If the pixel 2 steps to the right is a trail, turn a little to the right
- If the pixel 2 steps to the left is a trail, turn a little to the left
- Otherwise, go forward with a chance of turning left of right a small angle
